# ShellScript language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom/language-shellscript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/language-shellscript)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to shell scripts in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [ShellScript TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/shellscript.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

## Issues

* Please push issues [upstream](https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript).
* This issue tracker is more for me to personally outline the changes I would like to make to the snippets for planning purposes.
